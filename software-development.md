# Software Development

## Hiring
- Pay 1.5x for somebody 10x more productive than normal
- Provide the best tools to your people, since they're the best
- Hire developers that can talk to clients, so you don't need PMs

## In (rough) order, what a software project needs
- Source control
- DevOps
- Acceptance tests
- Simple infrastructure
- If third-party tools are needed, the ones chosen should be very popular
